#### Controls:
- Left Trigger
    - Rotating the sun
- Right Trigger
    - Interacting with Menus
    - Player movement teleport

There are platforms that only exist in the past or the present, and not the other way around.
Past ones will only be visible in the dark, and present ones will only exist were the light reaches.

In order to use the portals' teleport, portals need to be aligned visually.
The player's teleport has an indicator for where you can teleport to and where not.
